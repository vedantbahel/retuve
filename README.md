# Retuve - The first Open, Collaborative Framework for Infant Hip Health using AI

-----------------------------

Retuve (from the scottish gaelic `Ri taobh` meaning `beside`) is a framework for analysing infant hips. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible framework that can be used by developers, AI researchers and clinicians.

It takes in raw hip Ultrasound and X-Ray images, and outputs a report with the labelled images, and the results, exactly as a clinician would.

# Quickstart

**Please Note that the 2D Sweep and 3D DICOMs are sythetically stitched together from 2D Graf Hips, so do not expect accurate results. We are working on getting a 3DUS Case on a Creative Commons License to have as an example.**

To get started with Retuve, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/radoss-org/retuve.git
```

If you have docker, you can quick-run with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radoss-org/retuve && cd retuve
sudo docker run -i --rm \
  -v "${PWD}":/app/\
  -w /app \
  ghcr.io/radoss-org/retuve:latest python /app/examples/high_level_functions/3dus.py
```

You can then run the following code to get a basic report:

**WARNING: Before running this script, please make sure you have read the data disclaimer at `DATA_DISCLAIMER.md`.**


```python
import pydicom
from radstract.data.dicom import convert_dicom_to_images
from retuve.defaults.hip_configs import default_US
from retuve.defaults.manual_seg import manual_predict_us
from retuve.testdata import Cases, download_case
from retuve.funcs import analyse_hip_2DUS

# Example usage
dcm_file, seg_file = download_case(Cases.ULTRASOUND_DICOM)

dcm = pydicom.dcmread(dcm_file)
images = convert_dicom_to_images(dcm)

hip_data, img, dev_metrics = analyse_hip_2DUS(
    images[0],
    keyphrase=default_US,
    modes_func=manual_predict_us,
    modes_func_kwargs_dict={"seg": seg_file},
)

img.save("2dus.png")
```

# Examples

Examples can be found at https://github.com/radoss-org/retuve/tree/main/examples

# Docs

We have separate documentation for different use cases. Please see them all here:
- [Bringing your own DICOMs](docs/usecases/001-bringing-own-dicoms-xray.md)
- [Using Retuve with DICOMs](docs/usecases/002-using-retuve-trak.md)
- [All other guides](https://github.com/radoss-org/retuve/tree/main/docs/usecases)

We provide high level overviews for different types of users. This includes a tailored description of Retuve, and some highlighted features:

- [For Developers](docs/overviews/for_developers.md)
- [For AI Researchers](docs/overviews/for_ai_researchers.md)
- [For Clinicians](docs/overviews/for_clinicians.md)

# Modalities

Retuve can analyse Hips for:

- [Ultrasound](docs/modalities/ultrasound.md)
- [X-Ray](docs/modalities/xray.md)


# Developer Guide

You can clone the repository and install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radoss-org/retuve.git
```

You can then install retuve with poetry, and then run the tests:

**NOTE: These tests are about testing consistency between changes, and not directly testing the accuracy of the AI. See `changenotes` for tracking.**

```bash
# Needed for the scripts
pip install poethepoet

cd retuve
poetry install

# Generate the test data
poe testgen

# Run all tests, including examples.
poe test_all

# Get info on all other dev scripts
poe help
```

# Invitation for Collaboration

We are looking for support on the following:

- [ ] Landmark Models from litrature
- [ ] Native 3D Ultrasound Methods

We also accept any new algorithms for the different metrics, with the option to switch back to the old method provided through the config.

Please also see our [Milestones](https://github.com/radoss-org/retuve/milestones) for more information on what we are working on.
